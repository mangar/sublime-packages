## Pachage Control


### [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)

The simplest method of installation is through the Sublime Text console. The console is accessed via the ctrl+` shortcut or the View > Show Console menu. Once open, paste the appropriate Python code for your version of Sublime Text into the console.


#### Basic Functionality

Package Control is driven by the Command Palette. To open the palette, press ctrl+shift+p (Win, Linux) or cmd+shift+p (OS X). All Package Control commands begin with Package Control:, so start by typing Package.

### [CSS3](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/CSS3)
Features

* Absurdly Complete: I basically mined the entire set of draft specs and supported everything. Some of this stuff won't be implemented in browsers for years. With a few exceptions, if it's in the spec, it's supported.
* Productive: Full set of completions for every property, including many prefixed properties. W3C Validation.
* Modern: Bad, old CSS is flagged. Unnecessarily prefixed properties aren't highlighted. Catches lots of mistakes.
* Faithful: Follows the spec extremely closely, with minor deviations that encourage a few best practices (see below).

### [Nginx Syntax Highlighting](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/nginx)
This is a syntax highlighting plugin for Nginx configuration files in Sublime Text 2/3 that isn't completely broken. I was using the least broken plugin out there, kvs/ST2Nginx, but it was pretty broken for my Nginx files.

With this plugin, I have fixed many of those bugs and will actively maintain and extend it, as I frequently work with Nginx.
